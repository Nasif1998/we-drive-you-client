# Name of my project: We Drive You

This is basically a online vehicles booking service. In my project I tried to show 4 vehicles for people for travelling from one place to another place.

## Feature in this site:
1. After entering in the app in the navbar there are  home, destination, contact, blog and log in.
2. You should first log into the app because without it you can't use the app.
3. If you have no account you have to sign up after passing the validation.
4. You can also sign in with google and facebook account.
5. Then you can go to the description. There you can input route.


### In the description I tried to show google map but I failed. So I had to comment out the codes I wrote because for those code may entire description shows blank. So I had to comment out this. For submitting assignment I have to submit without google map but I'll look into it.
